# Lab 2 - Information Gathering

### Introduction
The first in class exercise introduced `tcpdump` and wireshark for capturing
packets.  Next we briefly covered `nmap` for basic network and host scans.  In
this lab we will dive deep into scans in an attempt to gather as much
information about a resources using different types of scanning techniques.

### Background
Be sure to brush up on the following topics:
* TCP packets
* TCP Handshake
* UDP packets
* CIDR notation
* Client/Server model
* various network protocols

Useful linux commands related to this lab:
`tcpdump, nmap, ping, python`
